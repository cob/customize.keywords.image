## customize.keywords.image

This customization will enable images and pdf files to have their
previews displayed on the frontend:
* When editing an instance, if the file is an image or a pdf file, a preview image will be displayed.
* When listing instances, a small image will be shown for each instance, this small image will be clickable to display the image in a larger size.

## How to use
To use this customization the user must use the following description:
**$file $image** or **$file $image([width:value,replaceFlag:(true|false)])**

The arguments **width** and **replaceFlag** are optional. 

**width** is the width of the displayed image.
**replaceFlag** shows and hides the button to upload another file.
